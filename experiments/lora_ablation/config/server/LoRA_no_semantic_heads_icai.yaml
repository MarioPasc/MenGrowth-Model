# LoRA Ablation Experiment Configuration - WITHOUT Semantic Heads
#
# This config disables auxiliary semantic prediction losses.
# Training uses only segmentation loss (Dice + CE).
# This is the control experiment for measuring the effect of semantic heads.

# =============================================================================
# EXPERIMENT NOTES
# =============================================================================
#
# This is the CONTROL experiment without semantic heads.
#
# Compare results with semantic_heads_icai.yaml to measure the effect of
# auxiliary semantic prediction on:
#
# 1. SEGMENTATION QUALITY
#    Does the auxiliary loss improve or hurt Dice scores?
#
# 2. REPRESENTATION QUALITY
#    Are semantic features more linearly decodable with auxiliary supervision?
#    Compare linear probe R² between experiments.
#
# 3. NONLINEARITY GAP
#    Does auxiliary supervision reduce the gap between linear and MLP probes?
#    A smaller gap suggests more linearly organized representations.
#
# The key question: Does "teaching to the test" (auxiliary semantic loss)
# improve or bias the learned representations?
