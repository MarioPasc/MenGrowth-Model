# =============================================================================
# METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
# =============================================================================
#
# This configuration implements several best practices for multi-task learning:
#
# 1. TARGET NORMALIZATION
#    Semantic targets are normalized to zero mean, unit variance to prevent
#    scale mismatch between loss components (Kendall et al., 2018).
#
# 2. AUXILIARY LOSS WARMUP
#    The auxiliary loss starts at epoch 5 and ramps over 10 epochs.
#    This allows the encoder to learn basic features before semantic pressure.
#
# 3. PER-FEATURE WEIGHTING
#    Shape features are harder to predict (R² ~0.25 vs ~0.70 for volume).
#    Reduced lambda_shape to 0.5 prevents the harder task from dominating.
#
# 4. GRADIENT MONITORING
#    Gradient norms are logged per parameter group to detect imbalances.
#    Check training_log.csv for encoder/decoder/semantic gradient norms.
#
# 5. EARLY STOPPING ON DICE
#    Early stopping uses validation Dice (primary metric), not total loss.
#    This prevents auxiliary loss improvements from masking segmentation degradation.
